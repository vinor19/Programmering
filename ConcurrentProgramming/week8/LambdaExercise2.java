	Let's make a more advanced box.
	
	- Create a new interface BoxFunction<I,O> with a method "apply" that
		takes something of type I (for input) as parameter and has O (for output)
	    as return type.
		
	- Modify the Box class by adding a new method called "apply" that:
		* Takes as parameter a BoxFunction<I,O> that requires as input something
		  of the same type of the content of the box.
		* Has the output type of the BoxFunction parameter as return type.
		* Its implementation applies the BoxFunction to the content of the box
		  and returns the result.

	- Modify the Box class constructor such that it throws an IllegalArgumentException
	  if the passed content is null.
